**Augmenting Rockburst Intensity Prediction**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of rockburst intensity prediction by training models on a larger and more diverse collection of datasets. The goal is to move beyond the limitations of traditional, smaller datasets and leverage a broader range of geological and operational parameters to create more robust and effective predictive models.
Rockbursts are a significant hazard in geotechnical engineering, particularly in deep underground mines and tunnels. Accurate prediction is essential for implementing proactive safety measures. This repository contains the code, data, and analysis related to this research.

**Features**
- **Data Augmentation:** We utilise a diverse range of datasets from various mining and tunnelling projects to create a comprehensive training corpus.
- **Advanced Predictive Models:** The project explores several machine learning and deep learning models to predict rockburst intensity.
- **Performance Evaluation:** The repository includes scripts for evaluating model performance using key metrics to demonstrate the improvement gained from data augmentation.
- **Reproducible Research:** All code and data preprocessing steps are documented, making the research fully reproducible.


**Contributing**
We welcome contributions to this project. If you are interested in improving the models, adding new datasets, or enhancing the analysis, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
